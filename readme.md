This repository contains my BIOS 6621 project for Assignment: R Markdown and Git.

## Directory structure

- `Background/`  
  Literature, project notes, and any non-code documentation that describes the scientific background and study design.

- `Code/`  
  All analysis code, including R scripts and R Markdown files used to clean data, run analyses, and generate figures/tables.

- `Reports/`  
  Knit reports (HTML, Word, PDF) and other write-ups that summarize data checking, methods, and results.

- `DataRaw/`  
  Original raw data files as received from the investigators (read-only; do not edit these by hand).

- `DataProcessed/`  
  Cleaned and derived data sets created from the raw data using code in the `Code/` folder.

The directory layout follows the general structure recommended by the **CIDAtools** package for reproducible projects.
